    <h2>Understanding the CANADA Score</h2>
    <p>The CANADA Score is our way of cutting through the complexity and giving you a clear, consistent measure of how Canadian a product or brand really is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>10/10</strong> – 100% Canadian: owned, made, and sourced here.</li>
      <li><strong>9/10</strong> – Canadian-owned, made here, with minimal foreign ingredients.</li>
      <li><strong>8/10</strong> – Canadian-owned, mostly made here, some imports.</li>
      <li><strong>7/10</strong> – Canadian-owned, but a lot of foreign sourcing.</li>
      <li><strong>6/10</strong> – Foreign-owned, but made in Canada.</li>
      <li><strong>5/10</strong> – Foreign-owned, about half Canadian-made.</li>
      <li><strong>4/10</strong> – Foreign-owned, some Canadian manufacturing.</li>
      <li><strong>3/10</strong> – Foreign-owned, Canadian-themed branding, little real contribution.</li>
      <li><strong>2/10</strong> – Foreign-owned, mostly made abroad, minimal Canadian presence.</li>
      <li><strong>1/10</strong> – Sold here, but zero meaningful Canadian economic involvement.</li>
    </ul>
