<h2>A Call to Arms: Buy Canadian; Protect our Country!</h2>
<p><em>April 28, 2025</em></p>

<p>Without getting too political, it seems safe to say that Trump is trying to cause anxiety, destabilization. That's why he picked today - election day - to raise annexation threats again.</p>

<p>You may think that you - the 'little guy' - don't have the power to elicit change. But you do! Collectively, our buying decisions can shift the playing field, can insulate our economy, can send a message to the US, and to the world, that Canada means business!</p>

<p>Every purchase is a vote.</p>

<p>Every dollar is a bargaining chip.</p>

<p>By buying Canadian, you are voting for the Canada we all know and love.</p>

<p>As a small piece of this puzzle, <a href="https://www.theCanadaList.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.theCanadaList.ca</a> is trying to make it as easy as possible to shop Canadian. Because let's face it: we're all busy, and we're all just trying to live our best lives. The easier it is to make smart buying decisions, the more people will stay involved.</p>

<p>To help, <a href="https://www.theCanadaList.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.theCanadaList.ca</a> currently includes over 6000 products, each one assigned a "CANADA Score" that considers who owns it, who manufactures it, where materials/ingredients are sourced, and how much it contributes to Canadian jobs. It's not yet perfect, but it's our best attempt at helping consumers feel confident that they are purchasing products that can most give back to the Canadian economy.</p>

<h3>Want to help? There are many ways for you to contribute:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make smart purchasing decisions!</strong> If you think our list may help you do this, please use it - it's fast, free and powerful.</li>
  <li><strong>Share the list with anyone you know who may be aligned to our cause, but who isn't currently making the best purchasing decisions.</strong> We as Canadians CAN make a difference. But it will take a community effort to do so!</li>
  <li><strong>If your favourite brands/products are missing, please let us know!</strong> We have tried to include as much as possible, but we want representation from coast to coast, and we need your help to get smaller, local businesses on the list.</li>
  <li><strong>Notice any mistakes?</strong> Let us know at <a href="mailto:mistakes@thecanadalist.ca">mistakes@thecanadalist.ca.</a> <strong>Have any suggestions?</strong> Let us know at <a href="mailto:suggestions@thecanadalist.ca">suggestions@thecanadalist.ca.</a> The whole point of the list is for it to be a helpful tool - if you think something could make it better, we're all ears!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But mostly, just do what you can to ensure that your own purchases are supporting what matters.</strong></p>

<p>On this of all days - election day - we are hopeful that the politician we vote into power will be able to solve the challenges facing our country, will be able to rudder our ship through these challenging waters. Hopefully they will. But what is becoming increasingly apparent is that they may need our help in doing so.</p>

<p>So let this be a Call to Arms: to be good custodians of the country we love, and to vote with our wallets as much as is in our means.</p>
